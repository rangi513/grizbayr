Bayesian Inference is a method of statistical inference that can be used in the analysis of observed data from marketing tests. Bayesian updates start with a prior distribution (prior probable information about the world) and a likelihood function (a distribution from which the samples are drawn). Then, given some observed data, the prior can be multiplied by the likelihood of the data to produce a posterior distribution of probabilities. At the core of all of this is Bayes' Rule. 

$$ P(A\ |\ Data) \sim P(Data\ |\ A) \cdot P(A)$$
