# grizbayr

## A Bayesian Inference Package for A|B and Bandit Marketing Tests

### Description:

Uses simple Bayesian conjugate prior update rules to calculate the following metrics for various marketing objectives:

      1. Win Probability of each option
      2. Value Remaining in the Test
      3. Percent Lift Over the Baseline
      
This allows a user to implement Bayesian Inference methods when analyzing the results of a split test or Bandit experiment.
      
Marketing objectives supported:

 - Conversion Rate
 - Revenue Per Session 
 - Cost Per Activation (CPA)
 - Total Contribution Margin (Revenue - Variable Cost)
 - Contribution Margin Per Click
 - Cost Per Click


The name is a play on Bayes with an added r (bayesr). The added griz (or Grizzly Bear) creates a unique name that is searchable due to too many similarly named packages.
